Solid Principles

[The SOLID principles are a valuable set of guidelines for writing better code. By following these principles, you can write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.](url)
In Python programming, "solid principles" typically refer to the SOLID principles, which are a set of five design principles that help you create maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are commonly used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one responsibility. This means that each class should only do one thing and do it well.
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or job. This promotes modular and maintainable code.
So, what does that mean actually? While you design your logic in either class or method, you should not be writing all kinds of responsibilities in one place. This will make your code quite complex and unmanageable. It will also be difficult to adjust new changes later as there are high chances it will affect the other functionality and you will end up testing all the functionalities even though it is a smaller change.
